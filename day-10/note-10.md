<h2>RustScan</h2>
<p>
  RustScan is a fast, open-source, and free port scanner written in Rust that can be used in Kali Linux. It can scan all 65,000 ports in about 3–8 seconds, 
  which is much faster than other tools like Nmap. RustScan is considered a valuable tool for cybersecurity professionals because of its speed, efficiency, 
  and versatility. It can be used for routine network audits or to hunt for vulnerabilities.
